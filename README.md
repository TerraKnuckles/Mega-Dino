Some sprites in this project belong Google and Capcom, like the dinosaur, the pterosaur, the meteor and the metal ball.

To execute this project, you will need just two modules, which are pygame and keyboard.

To install, you will need to write in your terminal (after you have installed python):
* pip install pygame
* pip install keyboard

With only these modules, you will be able to play this simple game by running the 'main.py' file.

Controls:
* X = Shot (hold to a big shot)
* Arrow keys = Horizontal movement, jump and crouch.

-> If you lose the game, you will need to close the window and run the file again.
